                <p>Its escape meant the utter ruin of our plan, and in all probability my instant death.  This thought lent wings to my feet; but even at my best I could do no more than hold my own with the leaping thing before me.</p>
                <p>Of a sudden it turned into an apartment on the right of the corridor, and an instant later as I rushed in I found myself facing two of the Mahars.  The one who had been there when we entered had been occupied with a number of metal vessels, into which had been put powders and liquids as I judged from the array of flasks standing about upon the bench where it had been working.  In an instant I realized what I had stumbled upon.  It was the very room for the finding of which Perry had given me minute directions.  It was the buried chamber in which was hidden the Great Secret of the race of Mahars.  And on the bench beside the flasks lay the skin-bound book which held the only copy of the thing I was to have sought, after dispatching the three Mahars in their sleep.</p>
                <p>There was no exit from the room other than the doorway in which I now stood facing the two frightful reptiles.  Cornered, I knew that they would fight like demons, and they were well equipped to fight if fight they must.  Together they launched themselves upon me, and though I ran one of them through the heart on the instant, the other fastened its gleaming fangs about my sword arm above the elbow, and then with her sharp talons commenced to rake me about the body, evidently intent upon disemboweling me.  I saw that it was useless to hope that I might release my arm from that powerful, viselike grip which seemed to be severing my arm from my body.  The pain I suffered was intense, but it only served to spur me to greater efforts to overcome my antagonist.</p>
                <p>Back and forth across the floor we struggled&mdash;the Mahar dealing me terrific, cutting blows with her fore feet, while I attempted to protect my body with my left hand, at the same time watching for an opportunity to transfer my blade from my now useless sword hand to its rapidly weakening mate.  At last I was successful, and with what seemed to me my last ounce of strength I ran the blade through the ugly body of my foe.</p>
